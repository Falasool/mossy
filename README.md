# What is Mossy



Mossy is a interplanetary microblogging platform of fediverse, just like [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) or [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey).

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20out-blue?style=for-the-badge)

## Why Mossy

Mossy is here to deliver an exceptional experience with cutting-edge technology.
According to that, Mossy can do much better to protect your information & personal identity
(**We don't even need your Email**).

We lovingly provide:

- **Full ActivityPub support**: Yes, Mossy supports ActivityPub

- **Accesse your Mossy from nearest point**: Place your server anywhere and everywhere all over the world, they share the same data
- **High performance**: Even a small server can handel a large number of requests from fediverse
- **Flexible cluster**: Join a new node into your cluster at your will
- **Compatible with Mastodon's APIs**: So any application developed for Mastodon can generally be used with Mossy as well (Maybe, we are tring)
- **Cluster of clusters**: Each Mossy Cluster can communicate with other Mossy Clusters, using algorithms to eliminate spam
- **Creator-friendly**: Mossy will be compatible with HDR photos and videos, and supports most wide color gamuts

# Getting Start

A typical deployment involves placing your Mossy web services behind a load balancer (also a SSL-terminate proxy). You can deploy Mossy nodes worldwide, connecting them via a shared storage. By configuring your load balancer carefully, users can access your Mossy through the nearest access point.

Communication between Mossy and end users is secured with HTTPS. However, connections from Mossy to databases, message queue or load balancer may be unsafe without protective measures like TLS or VPN.

After considered things above, use the `docker-compose.yml` to deploy a single production-ready server:

```yml
WIP
```

This deployment has:

- One single Mossy all-in-one node
- Database using PostgresSQL
- Message queue using Garnet
- Object storage using MinIO

And you need a reverse proxy or a load balancer in front of it. (Don't know how? Ask Cloudflare.)

For cluster deployment and other deploy information, please refer to [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

## Environment

**Do make sure every Mossy node has the same `CLUSTER_ID`, and DO NOT change it after.**

If you have clusters for databases and Redis, you can probably use different database and Redis URLs for every node. Otherwise make them the same.

## Using CDN

You may want to use CDN to accelerate access. The frontend of Mossy is a SPA, so you can deploy it separately.

Navigate to `frontend`, edit `.env.production`, set the correct `VITE_BASE_URL` to point to your backend server, load balancer or proxy. Then run `npm run build`. After that you can find everything you need in `frontend/dist`.

## Data Security

If yor choose to store your data locally, we would like to recommend LUKS with TPM2.

In the event of a physical breach, you can quickly destroy the decryption key to protect your data.

# Everything Else

## How Mossy Works

## Dev & Tests

<a href="https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmattholy%2Fmossy?ref=badge_large&issueType=license" alt="FOSSA Status"><img src="https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmattholy%2Fmossy.svg?type=large&issueType=license" align="right"/></a>

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

Before start, you need to install:

| Name   | Version |
| ------ | ------- |
| python | 3.12    |
| poetry | 1.8.2   |
| node   | 21.7.3  |
| npm    | 10.5.0  |

Everything else will be managed by `poetry` or `npm`

### Install dependences

- Install frontend dependence: `npm run install:frontend`
- Install backend dependence: `npm run install:backend`
- Install everything: `npm run install`

### Run your development server

- Run frontend development server: `npm run dev:frontend`
- Run backend development server: `npm run dev:backend`
- Pack it up and start a production like server: `npm run dev`
- Prepare a database for development only: `docker compose up -d`, to clean them up `docker compose down`

#### When you changed database schemas

Before you commit you change to remote.
Change your current working dir to backend (`cd backend`) and run `poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "[describe your changes here]"`, then run `poetry run alembic upgrade head` to update database.

The production image will update database automatically.

### Tests

#### Unit test

- Test frontend: `npm run test:frontend`
- Test backend: `npm run test:backend`
- Test everything: `npm run test`

#### Test locally

Run `docker compose --profile dev up --build`,then navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
